Problem Statement: 
Organizations often struggle to manage and analyze customer complaints efficiently due to manual processes, lack of prioritization, and limited analytical insights. Complaints are not systematically classified by severity or category, leading to delayed resolutions and reduced customer satisfaction. Additionally, feedback collected after complaint resolution is underutilized and not effectively analyzed. There is a need for an intelligent, analytics-driven complaint management system that integrates machine learning and business intelligence to improve operational efficiency, decision-making, and service quality.

What our platform does: 
•	Develop an analytics-driven customer complaint management platform with separate interfaces for customers and administrators.
•	Enable customers to raise complaints related to orders and provide feedback only after resolution.
•	Automatically classify each complaint by severity and category and potential escalation using a pre-trained machine learning model.
•	Allow administrators to monitor, prioritize, and resolve complaints based on severity and status along with summarization of complaints using Gen AI and base models highlighting certain complaint issues and preventions
•	Analyze post-resolution customer feedback using sentiment analysis to assess service effectiveness.
•	Generate Power BI dashboards to visualize complaint trends, resolution performance, and customer satisfaction.
